Microsoft HoloLens, the company's holographic, augmented reality headset, is a bold piece of hardware and the most exciting innovation in wearable tech yet !
Microsoft’s efforts amount to the most impressive device I have had a chance to work with in a long time. The Hololens opens up a new path in interaction design and game development. In the following days I'll try to share my experience in working with HL and the problems that occured along the way. But first and foremost lets take look at the device and see what's under the hood that makes it the most impressive wearable tech yet !

As a disclaimer I should point out that this device is not targeting the consumer market as of now and is still far from becoming one.

>>Powering each HoloLens is a 32-bit Intel Atom processor and Microsoft’s custom Holographic Processing Unit, or HPU. Using data generated by an inertial measurement unit, four spatial-mapping cameras, and a depth camera, the HPU creates a 3-D model of the surrounding environment. Apps can then use this model to position holograms without wasting the limited processing capacity of the energy-efficient Atom processor on handling sensor data. (As a Windows 10 device, HoloLens can run most 32-bit-processor-compatible Windows Universal Platform apps, which are available at the Windows Store. Nonholographic applications run as floating virtual screens that you place in your environment.)

>>By opting for such a specialized coprocessor, Microsoft has traded some flexibility for increased power and thermal efficiency. Still, the HoloLens would not be feasible without it. That is because the form factor of a head-mounted computer puts serious constraints on battery size and how much heat can be dissipated without causing discomfort.

If I was to list the awesomeness of HL

1. Untethered Mixed Reality
2. Windows 10 and its cool APIs _Windows10 was the best Windows. Ever._
3. Impressive spatial mapping
4. Spatial Audio
5.
