Terry Myerson â€“ EVP, Windows and Devices Group wasn't kidding when he [said](https://news.microsoft.com/speeches/satya-nadella-and-terry-myerson-build-2016/) that it really is such a great time to be a Windows developer. Now with the release of Unity for Hololens you can start developing for Microsoft Hololens with out purchasing any development tools. All you need is a Windows 10 machine with the specs they've mentioned, Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 (you can get the community edition free) , Unity HoloLens Technical Preview which is ready to download at from Unity3D.com
