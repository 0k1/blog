I've been blogging for a while at [wordpress](http://theblueasterisk.wordpress.com). And quite frankly I find the creating new post-posting-maintaining part quite disturbing. Hence the jekyll-ghpages migration. This blog is now hosted by github. Feel free to fork it at [github](https://github.com/blueasterisk/blog) . I've used a python script called [exitwp](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp) which converted my wordpress xml to markdown. The script isn't perfect. Most of my markdown files are messed up. I'll get back to that in a while. But now I can write my blog from anywhere I want and push the markdown file to git.
