Want to check whether a site is up in your app ? Isitup.org provides a neat way to do that. To get a json response simply send a httprequest to http://isitup.org/<yourwebsite>.json . The response from the south-east-asian dota 2 server of valve would look like this. [http://isitup.org/sgp-1.valve.net.json](http://isitup.org/sgp-1.valve.net.json).
