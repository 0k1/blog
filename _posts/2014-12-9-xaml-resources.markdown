Types of resources
==================

Resources in XAML commonly refer to the items that are being used multiple times in a page. So we can associate a key to a resource and each time we wish to refer the resource we can use the key instead. Resource keys together make a resourcedictionary. Most XAML elements can have its own resource dictionary. A page, usercontrol or even a control can have its own resourcedictionary. If you want to know more I'd recommend going through the [MSDN references.](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms750613.aspx) There are mainly 3 types of resources that we'd come across while trying to create an application in windows. 
They are 

 1. Static Resources
 2. Dynamic Resources

Static Resources are those which are evaluated before runtime. These get evaluated only once. Dynamic resources
