Try this.

Go to www.gmail.com

Create a new user

Choose a random username - let it be ksjadfhakjsdhfkjsg

Add google to that -  ksjadfhakjsdhfkjsggoogle

Voila ! - Someone already has that username. Try another?

This works the same if you use "microsoft".

But you CAN make accounts like yahoocantgethisfar@gmail.com

stupidapple884@gmail.com or facebooksucksmorethanmyvacuum@gmail.com. XD
